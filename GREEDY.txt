Greedy: every element in data structure (vector / array) is only considered once:

Tactic 1: consider each element once as the solution
Tactic 2: consider some elements for solution(a), and check if they are the solution (assumes elements after chosen one cannot be part of solution up to point(b))
Example : Gas station
