BACKTRACKING

Permutations - Backtracking 

for all elements 
if (it has not been picked) -> backtracking (mark element as picked)

add element at the end of recursion tree

Combinations - Backtracking 

for all elements 
AFTER ITERATOR -> backtracking (add element to combination and increase iterator)

add element at the end of recursion tree

Subsets
Subsets are the exact same thing as combinations (elements are or are not in set/combination)
the difference is subsets require combinations of all sizes

for all elements 
AFTER ITERATOR -> backtracking (add element to combination and increase iterator)

can also be created with cascading ->
iterating all nums
iterating all created subsets (for no duplicates use only created last time)
add num


OTHER

Subarrays -> use sliding window

Subsequences -> method varies (usually iteration)
