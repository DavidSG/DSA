. Erasing Elements
By Value: Removes all instances of the specified value.
ums.erase(5); // Removes all 5s

By Iterator: Removes the element at the specified iterator.
auto it = ums.find(10);
if (it != ums.end()) ums.erase(it); // Removes one occurrence of 10

count (returns num of elements) 
FIND ELEMENT


all elements with keys(range)
auto range = mm.equal_range(1);
for (auto it = range.first; it != range.second; ++it) {
    cout << it->first << " -> " << it->second << endl;
}

auto it = mm.find(1);
if (it != mm.end()) {
    cout << it->first << " -> " << it->second << endl; // Output: 1 -> apple
}


ORDERED
also ->

smallest & largest
*ms.begin()
*prev(ms.end()) (end is the next of the last)

auto it = ms.lower_bound(x): (first element that is >= x). 
Use --it for first element that is < x (as long as it is not begin)
ms.upper_bound(x): (first element that is > x). 
Use --it for first element that is <= x (as long as it is not begin)
